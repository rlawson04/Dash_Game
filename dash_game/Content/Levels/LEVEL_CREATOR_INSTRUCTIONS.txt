If you want to change the current custom level or create one of your own there are a couple rules to follow.
    1. On the first line of the text file you have to specify the dimensions of the level that you want to create.
       For example, a level layout with 6 rows and 8 columns would have the first line be formatted as "6,8".
       The next line of the file is where you can start putting the custom levels data.

    2. When messing around with room data itself there are only a few characters that you can use.
       Every level should include an S for the starting room.
       Battle rooms are defined by an integer less than 10 that holds that number of enemies.
       Boss rooms are defined by B.
       Finally item rooms are defined by I.

    3. Please ensure that there is a border of garbage characters around the level itself,
       garbage characters are other characters that have not been defined above.

Example level: (Same as the default custom level for the game)

6,8
XXXXXXXX
XXXXBXXX
XXXI3XXX
XX45S6XX
XXX3X5XX
